## ✅ Blur Effects Removed Successfully

### **Changes Made**

I have successfully removed all blur effects from both the ZKP Trade and History tabs:

#### **1. ActivePositions.tsx (ZKP Trade Tab)**
- **Removed**: `${isPrivateMode ? 'blur-sm hover:blur-none transition-all duration-300' : ''}` from Card className
- **Result**: ZKP positions now display clearly without any blur effects
- **Maintained**: All other styling and Private tags remain intact

#### **2. TradingHistory.tsx (History Tab)**  
- **Removed**: `${isPrivateMode && item.type === 'zkp' ? 'blur-sm hover:blur-none transition-all duration-300' : ''}` from Card className
- **Result**: All trading history items (both Private and Public) display clearly without blur
- **Maintained**: Privacy tags and functionality remain unchanged

### **What's Preserved**

✅ **Privacy Tags**: "Private" and "Public" badges still work correctly
✅ **Component Functionality**: All position management features intact  
✅ **Visual Design**: Clean, professional interface maintained
✅ **Responsive Layout**: All layouts continue to work perfectly
✅ **User Experience**: Clear visibility of all position data

### **Testing**

The changes have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Build successful without errors
- ✅ No blur effects on ZKP positions
- ✅ No blur effects on trading history
- ✅ All privacy tags and functionality preserved
- ✅ Clean, readable interface throughout

### **Impact**

Users will now have **crystal clear visibility** of all their ZKP positions and trading history without any blur effects, while maintaining all the privacy tagging and position management functionality.
